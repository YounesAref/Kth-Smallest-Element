-Program to find Kth smallest element in a BST
-To run program use g++ main.cpp then ./a.out
-To use program type the k smallest element you want to find in the BST

Program works by first filling up the BST with the contents of the array then printing it out in order then after getting input it finds the K smallest number then deletes the tree to avoid a memory leak.
All functions that deal with the tree use recursion to get to the leaf nodes.
